MC Plugin for Lava Wall minigame

# Summary
This is an old MineCraft Bukkit plugin I developed for playing a battleship-style 3V3 game on a multiplayer server. The rules of this game are inspired by a RoosterTeeth Lets Play where they came up with the concept - I have modified it to automate it for servers, and added new features (like an interactive display) and some additional game balancing. This accompanies a custom map I made, which is necessary for playing this game. The game logic is tied closely with the materials and architecture of the arena I made, so I highly recommend you use that map.

# Rules
Lava Wall is a 3V3 multiplayer game in which two teams are separated by a wall of lava, preventing the teams from seeing each other. Each team is equipped with fireball launchers and tries to use them to burn down a wool tower the other team has strategically placed on their side of the lava wall. Essentially, itâ€™s a team-based free-for-all game of Battleship.

In the spirit of Battleship, the Lava Wall acts as a giant display. Whenever your team burns blocks on the opposing team's side, the Lava will act like a display and change color to indicate where you got a successful hit. 

Teams can fortify their tower with wood by growing trees and harvesting them on their side of the arena. To increase the pace of tree growth, bones are useful; players can get bones by shooting players on the other side of the arena with bows and arrows. While visibility is hindered by the lava wall, un-crouching users can be identified by their gamer tags. 

Finally, as a final incentive to kill other players, if an opponent respawns 5 times or more, each additional death will spawn a Blaze into the arena which will assist your team by lobbing fireballs toward the opposing team's tower.
